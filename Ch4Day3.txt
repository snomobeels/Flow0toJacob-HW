1) What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")

Declare a destroy function, so that the nested resources can be destroyed.

2) Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

- include something to store metadata

Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? (insert thinking emoji here).

No, separate the minting/admin portion of the contract from the user side?

Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?

No, create reference(s) so you could borrow and view that information without needing to move things around.
